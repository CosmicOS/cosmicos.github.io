<h2>CosmicOS v2 preview</h2>

<p>
In this version of the message, the symbols that appear as plain
text in the <a href="message.html">plain text version</a> of the
message are instead shown as icons, chosen somewhat haphazardly from
<a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>.
</p>

<p>
In renderings of CosmicOS, symbols should be kept distinct
on as low a level as possible in the medium being used.  On paper,
that means using quirky squiggles with lots of character.
In audio, same principle.  In radio, same principle.  In the past,
CosmicOS assumed that the lowest level representation would be
a small number of basic symbols into which the message is encoded.
We no longer assume that.  If there's space in the physical medium
for more expression, let's use it in order to reduce the cognitive
burden on the receiving end.  Hammering this out will require careful
thought on the details of error probabilities and error correction.
CosmicOS offers flexibility so the message and the medium
can be better adapted to each other.

I'm cleaning up the rest of the message.  Read the <a href="message.html">plain text version</a> for now.
